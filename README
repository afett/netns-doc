How to setup a network namespace with iproute2

==== Create a veth pair ====

Create a veth pair with the device names host0 and guest0.
   ip link add name host0 type veth peer name guest0

==== Configure the the host interface ====

Set the host device up.
   ip link set host0 up

Add an address to the host device.
   ip address add 192.168.42.1/24 dev host0

Add a device route to the guest address via the host interface.
   ip route add 192.168.42.2/32 dev host0

Add additional routes to get the traffic from the guest to other
host interfaces.

==== Configure the guest interface ====

Create a network namespace named nsguest0.
   ip netns add nsguest0

Move the guest veth to the namespace nsguest0.
   ip link set guest0 netns nsguest0

From this point on the interface guest0 is no longer visible in the global network namespace.
Use "ip netns exec nsguest0 ip ...." to configure it. You can use "ip netns exec nsguest0 bash"
to get a bash running within this network namespace.

Optionally rename the guest interface (it may be the same name used in the global namespace).
   ip netns exec nsguest0 ip link set dev guest0 name foo0

Optionally change the mac address of the guest interface.
   ip netns exec nsguest0 ip link set dev foo0 address 52:54:00:0d:ae:35

Set the guest interface up.
   ip netns exec nsguest0 ip link set foo0 up

Add an ip address to the guest interface.
   ip netns exec nsguest0 ip address add 192.168.42.2/24 dev foo0

Add a default route to the guest interface.
   ip netns exec nsguest0 ip route add default via 192.168.42.1

Ping the gateway from the guest namespace.
   ip netns exec nsguest0 ping 192.168.42.1

You should see the traffic by running "tcpdump -eni host0" in the global network namespace.

==== Deconfigure the guest ====

Make sure there is no process (ie. ping) using this namespace anymore or you will get an
"device or resource busy" error.

Delete the guest namespace.
   ip netns delete nsguest0

Delete the veth pair.
   ip link delete host0

==== Misc ====

List all network namespaces.
   ip netns show
